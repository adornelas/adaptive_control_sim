# Adaptive Control Simulation for Mobile Robots

This repository contains simulation scripts to test linear velocity control using:
- Classic PID controllers
- Adaptive PID strategies

## Features

- Simulated first-order model of a differential-drive robot
- Sensor noise modeling (for encoder/IMU)
- Real-time parameter adaptation
- Visualization of system response and control signals
